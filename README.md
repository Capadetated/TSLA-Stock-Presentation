Should investors buy, hold, or sell Tesla (TSLA) stock? Volume and close price have steadily increased over time, but close price hit a boom early 2021 with an all-time high of $880 in Jan 2021. A forecast for Tesla stock close predicts that the price in Dec 2022 will be $2,564.81 based on the current trend. This is not likely to be accurate for a few reasons. It is difficult to predict how much the stock itself will grow (due to stock splits and a changing supply/demand). Thus, market capital (which represents the market value of the company [stock price x volume of stocks]) was analyzed. Tesla was far beyond any of its current competitors even before the Jan 2021 boom in terms of market capital. A second model forecasts market capital will be $765 billion in Dec 2021. It is likely Tesla will outperform this prediction since they have overdelivered for multiple years and have new models coming soon. Furthermore, tech stocks that spike quickly tend to either be a bubble (which then decreases drastically in value) or be a first wave (the second wave being far more lucrative). Based on the value Tesla has delivered and has promised, it is likely this is only the first wave. Thus, investors should hold their TSLA stock.
